This repository contains two code implementations of:
1. Decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal conversion.
2. Decimal floating-point numbers to binary conversion.
To run the code, clone the repository into VS Code and run from there. Optionally, you can copy paste the code into any IDE that supports C++ and run the code to display the outputs.
